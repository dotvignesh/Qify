<h1>Queuing and appointment booking system. </h1>

<h3>
We've created a "virtual clinic" mobile application üì± for Android and iOS (using Flutter and Firebase) during our participation in the KFAS <i>(Kuwait Foundation of Advanced Sciences)</i> & CODED's Virtual Hackathon - Emergency Resilience held in July 2020.
<p><p>
The main goal of the project was to eliminate the pressure created on medical systems during the COVID-19 pandemic by creating digital queues for patients to consult their doctors. This would help in resolving mild cases, which can be treated over a video call.
<p>
  <i>Out of the 40 teams that took part, we stood in the top 7, and were in the list of 5 teams that qualified to the final round. ‚ò∫Ô∏è</i>

The application's features include:
<ul>
<li>Registering & logging in as a doctor/ patient. Different UIs for both.
<li>An admin approves/rejects a doctor's profile.
<li>The doctor can create (& edit, delete) an appointment window.
<li>The patient can search for a doctor, and pick a specific window to book an appointment.
<li>The doctor can accept or reject an appointment. They also have the option to transfer the appointment to another doctor.
<li>The patient gets an email reminder before any appointment.
<li>The doctor gets to start a voice/video call with the patient. (uses Jitsi API)
</ul>
